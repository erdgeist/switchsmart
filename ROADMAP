The kernel module only does the lowlevel (timing critical) communication with
the rfm12-module (via SPI) - and exports a device node to userspace, as:

    /dev/rfm12_ask

Opening / closing the device will power on / power off TX respectively.

The protocol used for communication between kernel- / userspace on top of
/dev/rfm12_ask will be sth. like:

    struct ask {
        u8 sequence[],
        u8 interval,
        u8 count,
    }

There'll be a userspace library handling the communication with the kernel,
exporting maybe functions, e.g. for remote controllable power sockets
using the 2272 controller:

    2272_on(u8 system_code, u8 socket_code);
    2272_off(u8 system_code, u8 socket_code);
